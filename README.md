# Video-Synced-Online-NoteBook

In this application, we can play the videos on one half of the GUI and take notes on the other half. Whenever a user moves the mouse to the notes section, the video gets paused and we can take the notes. Also the portion of the video at which the note was taken, is attached to the note. At the end, the notes are stored in the database.

In future, when the user is refering to the notes and wants to look at the video again, he can click on the note which then plays the scetion of video at which the note was taken.
